- Current progress: I started my journey around 2/20/24 with free resources, Originally starting off with CS50P, Then trying free code camp.. and dozens of other playforms. Eventually i settled on FCC and CS50x, which i rotated between. So far, ive completed the responsive web design certification,(Which consists of 5 html/css projects), completed about half of CS50P, and started CS50x. I'm also currently enrolled in community college in a computer science program, where i will be required to learn java and C++.
