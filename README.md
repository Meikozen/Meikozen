- Current progress: I started my journey around 2/20/24, Originally starting off with CS50P, Then trying free code camp.. and dozens of other playforms. Eventually i settled on FCC and CS50x, which im basically rotating between. So far, ive completed the responsive web design certification,(Which consists of 5 html/css projects) almost completed the basic HTML section of the FCC ciriculum, completed about half of CS50P, and started CS50x.
